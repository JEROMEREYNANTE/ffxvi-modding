# :material-texture: Texture Extraction

Most textures in the game are contained within `.tex` files.

1. If you don't already have it, get [FF16Tools](https://github.com/Nenkai/FF16Tools).
2. To extract textures, simply drop any `.tex` file (or folders) into `FF16Tools.CLI.exe`. A folder will be created.

!!! tip
    
    You can also use the command-line way with `tex-conv` if you'd like.
