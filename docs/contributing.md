If you're like to improve the site, the repository is available [here](https://github.com/Nenkai/ffxvi-modding)! Feel free to help out in any way.

Everything uses easy-to-write markdown for documentation with a few additions that you can see in the [Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) reference.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended to easily edit and preview in real-time.
